  description: >
    CityCAT (City Catchment Analysis Tool) is a unique software tool for modelling, analysis and visualisation of surface water flooding.
    CityCAT enables rapid assessment of combined pluvial and fluvial flood risk and allows assessment of the effects of different flood alleviation measures.
    This DAFNI model generates input data for CityCAT, runs a simulation and then converts the output data.
    All input data is assumed to be projected in [OSGB 1936](https://epsg.io/27700).
    The domain is generated either using a boundary polygon or a combination of centroid location and size.
    A rainfall total can either be specified directly or extracted from FUTURE-DRAINAGE based on a return period, duration and time horizon.
    The storm profile is generated using the FEH summer profile.
    The effects of buildings, green areas and inflow boundary conditions can be included.
    Results are provided in a range of formats and a metadata JSON file is created which can be used to create DAFNI datasets.
